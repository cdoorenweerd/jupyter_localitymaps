# jupyter_localitymaps
Jupyter notebooks with python code to plot geographic maps with various backgrounds and locality markers based on lat longs from a csv input file.

The Cartopy, Stamen, and ESRI examples produce static maps that can be used in publications, presentations, etc. but be sure to include the appropriate copyright credits. The folium interactive map is useful for exploring your data and figuring out why some data points are in the middle of the ocean.

For all notebooks, the lat long markers are plotted via matplotlib; see all marker options here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html

Recommended usage for these notebooks is from within an anaconda environment with the required dependencies https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/index.html.
