# jupyter_localitymaps
Jupyter notebooks with python code to plot geographic maps with locality markers based on lat longs from a csv input file.

The cartopy and ESRI examples produce static maps that can be used in publications, presentations, etc. The folium interactive map is good for exploring your data and figuring out why some data points are in the middle of the ocean.

Recommended usage for these notebooks is from within an anaconda environment with the required dependencies.
